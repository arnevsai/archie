# Archie Bot
Archie, a stripped down version of the Arnev Sai Discord Bot.

**What is it?**

Archie (officially named Archie Sai) is a stripped down version of it's bigger version, Arnev Sai. While they operate similarly, there are some differences. 
The main differences between Arnev Sai and Archie are:
  * Archie is strictly focused on moderation rather than fun and music.
  * Archie is fully open source*. This means you can customize Archie to your likings through code.
  * Archie is light on hardware resources. DIY that Archie itself is ran off of a Raspberry Pi?!
  
*There may be plans to make Arnev Sai open source, stay tuned!*

**How do I get it up and running?**

There are two ways you can get Archie working. You can
  * Download a release build and run it.
  * Clone this repository and run it straight from source.

Note: To use these options, you need to provide your own bot token. You can put the token in the config.json file in the **archie-data** directory.

If you successfully got Archie up and running with your own token, you may want to generate an OAuth2 URL. This URL is your invite link to let other people add your bot. You can find a button for it on the "My Apps" section of the Discord developer website.

**That sounds difficult! Is there any easier way?**

If you just want to add our bot to your server, use this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=416160277675900929&permissions=8&scope=bot

This is very easy to do but you may lose out on some of the customization features! (This is subject to change)

**What next?**

So you've got Archie added and it is fully up and running. That's great, congratulations!
Now all you have to do is use it! Simple, right?

We highly suggest you to join our support server in case of issues, etc. or just general talk. Link: https://discord.gg/pvAzcyX
